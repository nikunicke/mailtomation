# mailtomation

**work in progress**

Mailtomation is a simple package that collects email messages using the Gmail API. To run locally, you need application credentials that can be retrieved [*here*](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/go).

Currently only reads unread mails, marks them read and saves them into a simple csv dataset, which for example could be used for intent recognition.
